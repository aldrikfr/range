All contributions are welcomed, here the process : 
* if you have an idea, share it in order to check there isn't already a work on it.
  * On my part I push on a regular basis my commits using feature branch.
  * You can explore all the branches, ask me for more information if needed.
  * Send an email if you have a doubt.
* Avoid when possible to modify mli files
* make a pull request
